# Boojum Mentorship Program

It's just a repo where I try and complete the tasks given to me by the cryptography engineers at Matter Labs in order to deeply understand the Boojum proving system. The eventual hope is that this deep knowledge combined with my own skills will help uncover and ideally avoid any security issues with this proving systems and it's implementation.
